Brief description of data files:

1. AVETable.csv is currently being used by svgcreator to build the svg element functions. 

It is created by AEVL.R by scraping 
 url="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/attindex.html" 
and following the links


2. elementSummary.csv is currently being used to generate documentation for elements and
regular attributes. 

It is created by elementSummary.R by scraping the pages occurring as links found on
"http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/eltindex.html"

elementSummary and AVETable should (in principle) contain the same information

3.  presentationAttr.csv
contains details of the presentation properties (attributes)

Is created by presentationAttr.R by scraping the pages:
"text.html",  "masking.html",  "painting.html", "color.html", "interact.html", "filters.html", "pservers.html"

4. propIndex.csv
also contains details of presentation properties. 

Created by propertyIndx.R by scraping a single page: url="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/propidx.html"
 propIndx.csv appears to contain the same info that presentationAttr.csv, the difference is the source
and propIndx is wide while presentationAttr is long


5. Terminology.csv
defines element classes such as shapes and also some attribute classes. Not known if this information is implict in elementSummary.csv

Obtain by scrapping the single page http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/intro.html#Terminology
